/** @defgroup FUTURE Future
 * A future, an eventual, or a \a promise, is a mechanism for passing a value
 * between threads, allowing a thread to wait for a value that is set
 * asynchronously. It is used to increase concurrency in a parallel program.
 * This construction is really popular in functional programming languages,
 * in particular MultiLisp. If the programmer defines a future containing
 * an expression, the runtime system \a promises to evaluate that expression
 * concurrently. The resulting value of the expression might not be available
 * immediately, but it will be eventually computed. Therefore, futures also
 * require a synchronization interface between the program and the multiple
 * concurrent threads that may be computing portions of the code.
 *
 * In Argobots, futures are used with the purpose of synchronizing execution
 * between cooperating concurrent ULTs. There are two basic mechanisms
 * implemented, \ref EVENTUAL "eventuals" and futures.
 *
 * A \a future in Argobots has a slightly different behavior. A future is
 * created with a number of \a compartments. Each of those \a k compartments
 * will be set by contributing ULTs. Any other ULT will block on a future
 * until all the compartments have been set. In some sense, a future is
 * a multiple-buffer extension of an eventual. Eventuals and futures have
 * a different philosophy of memory management. An eventual will create and
 * destroy the memory buffer that will hold a result. In contrast, a future
 * does not create any buffer. Therefore, a future assumes each contributing
 * ULT allocates and destroys all memory buffers. When a contributing ULT
 * sets a value, it just passes a pointer to the particular memory location.
